                  NYC-based personal stylist and shopping expert with 
                  over five years of experience in the fashion industry. My career spans luxury

                  personal styling business, where I provide curated wardrobe solutions for

                  At my roles at Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, I managed a multi-million-dollar 
                  portfolio, styling high-profile clients, and exceeding sales goals through 
                  personalized recommendations.

                  As an independent stylist, I've collaborated with photographers and sourced 
                  exclusive pieces to create standout looks for events like New York Fashion 
                  Week. My personal shopping and styling services focus on delivering seamless, 
                  high-touch experiencesâ€”from boutique access to event styling.
